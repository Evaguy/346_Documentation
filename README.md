# 346_Documentation
Documentation of multiple projects in school/EPSIC for the ICT branch 346.

## How can I request a language ?
TODO :p

Probably do smth with PR ig.

## How can I fix the spelling ?
To fix the spelling in any documentation, you can head into the "Issues" section of this repo, and create a new issue.

The issue name should be clear so that I know which documentation needs to be fixed (ex. small typo in /blabla/blabla.md)

And don't forget to add the label : "spelling issue" to your issue !

## TODO :
* Finish, add and translate the third documentation about scalability in Azure
* Add how to request a language in this README.md
