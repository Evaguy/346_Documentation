Create and add the translated documentation in the right folder (please :p).

Finally do a PR in this repo !

## How can I fix the spelling ?
To fix the spelling in any documentation, you can head into the "Issues" section of this repo, and create a new issue.

The issue name should be clear so that I know which documentation needs to be fixed (ex. small typo in /blabla/blabla.md). It sould also contains where the spelling issues is (ex. this typo is at line 22).

And don't forget to add the label : "spelling issue" to your issue !
