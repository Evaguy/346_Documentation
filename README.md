[//]: <> (To actually rewrite, im almost not sure this is how PR are done lmao)
Clone the repo on your machine.

Create and add the translated documentation in the right folder (please :p).

Finally do a PR in this repo !

### How can I fix the spelling ?
To fix the spelling in any documentation, you can head into the "Issues" section of this repo, and create a new issue.

The issue name should be clear so that I know which documentation needs to be fixed (ex. small typo in /blabla/blabla.md). It sould also contains where the spelling issues is (ex. this typo is at line 22).

And don't forget to add the label : "spelling issue" to your issue !

### How can I add details ?
Head again into the "Issues" section of this repo, and create a new issue.

[//]: <> (To rewrite!!! lol)
State what details you want to add or modifiy (don't forget to tell me where you want to add them).

This time you'll need to add the label "details missing" to your issue.
