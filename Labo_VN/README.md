In this project, I've configure a [virutal network (VN)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview), for two machine to communicate each other, in Azure.

This documentation goes around all the settings I had to setup, in Azure, for my virtual network.

If anyone wants to translate every images, and fix the spelling in "Labo_VN_EN.md" then go for it. Don't think I'll do anything else in this documentation... For me the english documentation is done.
