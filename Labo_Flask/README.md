Documentation of a project in school for the ICT branch 346.

In this project, I've configure [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), a lightweight web application framework, on a virtual Debian 12 hosted on Azure.

## TODO :
* Fix the current documentation with the final documentation. I think I've changed some things when I migrated the .md file to Word lmao :) 
* Translate the documentation in English. Right now it's in French...
