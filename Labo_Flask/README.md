In this project, I've configure [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), a lightweight web application framework, on a virtual Debian 12 hosted on Azure.

## TODO :
* If anyone wants to translate every images, and fix the spelling in "Labo_Flask_EN.md" then go for it. Don't think I'll do it... For me the english documentation is done
